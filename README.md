**Problem statement**
Stock prices have a high degree of nonlinearity and volatility. It is highly difficult to predict stock values because they depend on a variety of variables, including market emotion, political activity, global policies, the stock's fundamentals, etc. The profitability of an investment is significantly influenced by changes in stock price. The investor's earnings can be maximized by accurate stock price forecasting.
ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) is adopted here to perform time series analysis.

**Outcomes**
ARIMA models are capable of capturing autocorrelation, which is the correlation between a time series and its lagged values. In stock markets, prices are often influenced by their previous values, and ARIMA can effectively model this autocorrelation to make predictions. They may not capture complex nonlinear relationships, sudden changes in market conditions, or external factors that impact stock prices. Therefore, it's recommended to complement ARIMA models with other techniques and factors when making stock predictions.
